# easy-way

Finding your way through the supermarket - the easy way. ðŸ¤™

## Features

The project provides two features:

* We can calculate the shortest path between any two items, using the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
* We can calculate the shortest tour from entrance to checkout that passes all items on your shopping list, using the [Concorde TSP solver](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html).

The features are exposed through an [OpenAPI v3](https://swagger.io/specification/) API and made available in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

For end-users, we also developed an Android app.

## Documentation
